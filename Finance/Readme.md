### ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Inside:

* **Kalman Filter Smoothing**: Denoises daily closing prices and overlays a moving average on candlestick charts.
* **ARIMA Forecasting**: Uses `auto_arima` to automatically select the best model parameters and generate a 6-month forecast.
* **LSTM Neural Network**: Implements a Keras-based LSTM model trained on 60-day historical sequences to predict future stock prices for the next 30 days.
